Task
----

Write a function that performs a left cyclic bitwise shift.  
The function should take two parameters:  
 - ```unsigned int``` - input value that should be shifted;  
 - ```unsinged int``` - shift (number of bits).  

The function must return a shifted value of the ```unsigned int``` type.
